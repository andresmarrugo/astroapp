<p className="pb-3">Hi there! I am a laid-back and respectful person who enjoys exchanging ideas and engaging in thoughtful discussions. I strongly believe in non-violence and believe that a world full of ideas and diversity is a better world.‚òÆÔ∏è</p>

<p className="pb-3">I am a curious person who is always interested in what is happening in the world across different fields such as technology, economy, scientific research, culture, and more. I am particularly passionate about technology and how it has positively impacted my productivity. I am also a fan of artificial intelligence and the way it is shaping our world.</p>

<p className="pb-3">In addition to technology, I have a deep interest in the crypto ecosystem and am a proud Bitcoin <FaBitcoin className="inline text-orange-500"/> enthusiast. I love learning about science and find it fascinating, just as I did as a child when I dreamed of having a microscope.</p>

<p className="pb-3">When I am not exploring new ideas, I enjoy spending time with animals, especially cats üêà, and find their intelligence and personalities to be captivating. I also have a green thumb and love growing my own tomatoes at home. üå±</p>
